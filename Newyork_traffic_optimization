First we will load data from local machine to virtual machine by using filezila

First we will create table from csv data
create table sales_order_orcs
 (order_number string,
 quantity_ordered int,
     price float,
     order_line int,
     sales float,
     status string,
     qtr_id int,
     month_id int,
     year_id string,
     product_type string,
     msrp int,
     product_code string,
     phone string,
     city string,
     state string,
     postal_code string,
     country string,
     teritory string,
     last_name string,
     first_name string,
     deal string)
 row format delimited
 fields terminated by ',';
 
 
Create the schema for orc table
> create table sales_order_orc
    > (order_number string,
    > quantity_ordered int,
    > price float,
    > order_line int,
    > sales float,
    > status striong,
    > qtr_id int,
    > month_id int,
    > year_id string,
    > product_type string,
    > phone string,
    > city string,
    > state string,
    > postal_code string,
    > country string,
    > teritory string,
    > last_name string,
    > first_name string,
    > deal string)
    > stored as orc;
    
 Migrate the data
 from sales_order_csv insert overwrite sales_order_orcs select *;
 
 Performing Group By operation
 Calculatye total sales per year:
 
  select year_id, sum(sales) from sales_order_orcs group by year_id;
